# vshooter
a vertical ~~~space shooter~~~, made with luxe engine.

trying to make an action game that feels like a space shooter, but is non-violent.

Ideas are stemming from dropping off food packages to drop spots on the ground, and 'high-fiving' other planes with wings to get power ups.
Maybe a way to make enemies friendly by holding them in the aim...

Aiming: have a reticule that sits in front of ship, have to hold the target in that zone for a few seconds. some kind of snapping will make this easier.
